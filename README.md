# Deep-Learning
This project was implemented as part of the postgraduate studies in Computational Intelligence and Digital Media. 
The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with the basic types of deep neural network architectures and their training to solve problems of our choice. The architectures and training methods that were required to be explored included the following:

1. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2. Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers
3. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

# For Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a dataset for facial emotion recognition was selected from Kaggle. This dataset consists of 35,887 images, each 48x48 pixels in grayscale. Each image represents a different emotion. The emotions depicted in the images are: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. We dealt with a multi-class image classification problem involving seven classes.
